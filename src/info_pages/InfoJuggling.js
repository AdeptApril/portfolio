                <p>April is a skilled juggler, having managed to successfully juggle seven balls (at once, for those literal-minded), and even more skilled as a teacher, having taught hundreds of people how to juggle or use other props.</p>
                <p>While this is a little further afield than other projects on this site, she has enjoyed showing how she can explain complicated topics in straight-forward ways. Teaching you how to juggle is one of the ways she can demonstrate her skill in communicating, while doing something that looks pretty neat.</p>
